# Claude Auto-Improvement Log

This file records every autonomous improvement cycle run on this codebase.

---

## Cycle #1
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-17 23:38–23:50 Eastern
**Git commit:** `d2cd69f`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights

**Phase 0 — Architecture:**
~2600-line MCP server (index.ts) with 5 services, permissions layer, escalation system, and settings UI. 30+ tools exposed. All tools route through `permissions.check()` except two meta escalation tools.

**Phase 1 — Functionality:**
- MEDIUM: `get_emails_by_label` used unvalidated `args.label` to build IMAP path `Labels/${label}` — same traversal risk as constructing `Labels/../INBOX`
- MEDIUM: `move_to_folder` used unvalidated `args.folder` to build `Folders/${folder}`
- MEDIUM: `remove_label` and `bulk_remove_label` used unvalidated `args.targetFolder` directly as IMAP path
- LOW: `list_labels` brittle detection pattern (minor)
- LOW: `Math.min(...dates)` spread risk on large arrays in analytics (mitigated by 200-email cap)

**Phase 2 — Logic:**
- Rate-bucket memory is bounded by tool count (~45). No leak.
- Analytics cache inflight correctly uses finally block.
- Scheduler items array has no growth cap on completed records (noted for future cycle).

**Phase 3 — Security:**
- HIGH/MEDIUM: 4 handlers missing label/folder validation before IMAP path construction (fixed this cycle)
- All header injection defenses verified (stripHeaderInjection applied to subject, inReplyTo, references, custom headers, filenames, contentType)
- Attachment limits, recipient caps, email validation RFC 5321 compliance all verified

**Phase 4 — Documentation:**
- `migrateCredentials` import in index.ts is used (line 2589) — initial assessment was incorrect
- Duplicate step "3." in graceful shutdown comments (minor, noted for future cycle)

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`get_emails_by_label`** — Added label validation (non-empty, no `/`, no `..`, no control chars, max 255 chars) before constructing `Labels/${label}` IMAP path. Matches existing validation in `move_to_label`. (+10 lines)

2. **`move_to_folder`** — Added folder validation (same rules) before constructing `Folders/${folder}` IMAP path. (+10 lines)

3. **`remove_label`** — Added `targetFolder` validation (no `..`, no control chars, max 1000 chars) before use as direct IMAP path. Defaults to INBOX when omitted/empty. (+9 lines)

4. **`bulk_remove_label`** — Same targetFolder validation as `remove_label`. (+10 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+39 lines), `LAST_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` (new)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm run lint` — PASS (tsc --noEmit clean)
- `npm test` — PASS (212/212 tests, 14 test files)

### Git Status

- Commit: `d2cd69f`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #2:**
1. Add a cap/cleanup to `SchedulerService.items` — prune completed/failed/cancelled records older than N days to prevent unbounded growth
2. Fix comment numbering in graceful shutdown (two "3." labels)
3. Investigate `list_labels` detection logic — consider whether `f.name?.startsWith("Labels/")` check is needed
4. Consider adding `Analytics.getEmailStats()` `Math.min(...dates)` spread to use reduce instead
5. Add test coverage for new label/folder validation in the new handlers (unit tests for `get_emails_by_label`, `move_to_folder`, `remove_label`, `bulk_remove_label` with invalid inputs)

---

## Cycle #2
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-17 23:50–00:00 Eastern
**Git commit:** `6202880`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `scheduler.ts` — `this.items` array has no growth cap (now fixed)
- `analytics-service.ts` — `Math.min/max(...dates)` spread pattern (now fixed)
- `index.ts` — graceful shutdown had two "// 3." comments (now fixed)
- `index.ts` — `list_labels` had redundant `f.name?.startsWith("Labels/")` condition (now fixed)
- Validation in 4 handlers was inline-only, not testable from outside (now extracted to helpers)

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Extract validation helpers to `src/utils/helpers.ts`** — Added `validateLabelName`, `validateFolderName`, and `validateTargetFolder` as exported functions, each returning `null` on success or an error message on failure. (+65 lines)

2. **Refactor 4 handlers in `src/index.ts` to use helpers** — `get_emails_by_label`, `move_to_folder`, `remove_label`, `bulk_remove_label` now call the helpers instead of inline blocks. No behavior change. (-39 lines inline, +8 lines calls)

3. **Add 30 new unit tests** — 27 tests in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` covering all branches of the three new validation functions (empty, whitespace-only, null, slash, dotdot traversal, control chars, exact-limit boundary, over-limit). 2 tests in `src/services/scheduler.test.ts` for history pruning. (+166 lines)

4. **`SchedulerService.pruneHistory()` in `src/services/scheduler.ts`** — New private method called from `load()`. Keeps all pending items, drops non-pending records older than 30 days, caps non-pending history at 1000 records (sorted newest-first). (+55 lines)

5. **Fix `Math.min/max` spread in `src/services/analytics-service.ts`** — `getEmailStats()` now uses `reduce` for oldest/newest date computation. (+3 lines, -2 lines)

6. **Fix graceful shutdown comment** in `src/index.ts` — Second "// 3." changed to "// 4." (1 line)

7. **Remove redundant condition from `list_labels`** in `src/index.ts` — Removed `|| f.name?.startsWith("Labels/")` (IMAP folder `name` is the leaf, never has a path prefix). (1 line)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (242/242 tests, 14 test files, +30 new tests vs 212 in cycle 1)

### Git Status

- Commit: `6202880`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #3:**
1. `move_email` and `bulk_move_emails` — `targetFolder` passed directly to `imapService.moveEmail()` without validation. Add `validateTargetFolder()` for consistency. (~5 lines, LOW risk)
2. `send_test_email` — add `isValidEmail(args.to)` check at handler level before SMTP. (~5 lines, LOW)
3. `parseEmails` silent dropping — log a warning for dropped invalid addresses in helpers.ts (~5 lines)
4. Cursor token HMAC binding — bind cursor to server instance (prevents cursor forgery). Low security impact.
5. IMAP connection health check (`NOOP` before ops) — medium effort, moderate risk

---

## Cycle #3
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:00–00:10 Eastern
**Git commit:** `d4a261a`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1 & 2 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `move_email` handler — `args.targetFolder` passed to `imapService.moveEmail()` without `validateTargetFolder()` (now fixed)
- `bulk_move_emails` handler — same gap (now fixed)
- `send_test_email` handler — `args.to` not validated before SMTP (now fixed)
- `parseEmails` — silently dropped invalid addresses with no log (now fixed)

**Additional audit findings (no new issues):**
- `archive_email`, `move_to_trash`, `move_to_spam` use hardcoded literal strings — no validation needed
- All 4 handlers that accept caller-supplied `targetFolder` now uniformly use `validateTargetFolder()`
- `send_email` delegates validation to smtpService; `send_test_email` now validates at handler level first

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`move_email`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(args.targetFolder)` check before `imapService.moveEmail()`. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` for `..`, control chars, or oversized strings. (+4 lines)

2. **`bulk_move_emails`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(args.targetFolder)` check before iterating IDs. Fails fast before touching any email. (+3 lines)

3. **`send_test_email`** — Added `isValidEmail(args.to)` check at handler entry. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams, "Invalid recipient email address: <addr>")`. (+3 lines)

4. **`parseEmails` in `src/utils/helpers.ts`** — Imported `logger`. Rewrote filter to a `for` loop that calls `logger.warn(...)` for each dropped invalid address. Callers using CC/BCC paths will now see warnings in logs. (+11 lines, -3 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+10 lines), `src/utils/helpers.ts` (+17 lines, -5 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (242/242 tests, 14 test files)

### Git Status

- Commit: `d4a261a`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #4:**
1. Add tests for the new `move_email`, `bulk_move_emails`, `send_test_email` handler-level validation (invalid targetFolder / invalid email address inputs)
2. Cursor token HMAC binding — bind cursor JSON to HMAC-SHA256 keyed on a server-startup secret (LOW security impact, medium effort)
3. IMAP reconnect on silent TCP drop — `ensureConnection()` NOOP check (MEDIUM risk, medium effort)
4. `send_test_email` body emoji cleanup (cosmetic, trivial)
5. Review any remaining handlers that receive free-text user input without sanitization

---

## Cycle #4
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:10–00:15 Eastern
**Git commit:** `8ce8e69`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1, 2, & 3 fixes still intact.

**Audit areas checked:**
- `src/index.ts` — all folder/email handlers verified using `validateTargetFolder()`, `validateLabelName()`, `validateFolderName()`, or `isValidEmail()` as appropriate. No gaps found.
- `encodeCursor`/`decodeCursor` confirmed present at lines 155–175 of index.ts. Cursor is base64url JSON with field-type validation on decode. HMAC binding remains on the architectural backlog.
- `send_test_email` emoji — confirmed in `smtp-service.ts` (email body), NOT in the tool description. CONTRIBUTING.md rule applies to tool descriptions only, but emoji in email subjects/bodies can cause rendering issues in some clients. Fixed as cosmetic cleanup.
- Handler-level validation for `move_email`, `bulk_move_emails`, `send_test_email` — confirmed correct in index.ts. No unit tests existed for these paths (index.ts cannot be imported in tests due to top-level env-var checks). Tests added to `helpers.test.ts` exercising the exact validation calls the handlers make.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Add 16 unit tests for Cycle #3 handler validation** — Added three `describe` blocks to `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `move_email handler validation (validateTargetFolder)` — 6 tests: valid INBOX, valid path with slash, traversal `../../etc`, null-byte injection, oversized string, undefined (omitted) input
   - `bulk_move_emails handler validation (validateTargetFolder)` — 3 tests: valid destination, path traversal `Folders/../INBOX`, control character injection
   - `send_test_email handler validation (isValidEmail)` — 7 tests: valid address, missing domain, missing `@`, null byte, newline (header injection), empty string, local part >64 chars
   (+105 lines in helpers.test.ts)

2. **Remove emoji from `sendTestEmail` body in `src/services/smtp-service.ts`** — Subject changed from `"🧪 Test Email from ProtonMail MCP"` to `"Test Email from ProtonMail MCP"`. H2 and paragraph emoji removed. Plain ASCII text only. (-3 emoji occurrences)

**Files changed:** `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+105 lines), `src/services/smtp-service.ts` (3 lines changed)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (258/258 tests, 14 test files, +16 new tests vs 242 in cycle 3)

### Git Status

- Commit: `8ce8e69`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #5:**
1. Cursor token HMAC binding — STILL SKIPPED (medium complexity, low security payoff). Defer until a dedicated cycle.
2. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — STILL SKIPPED (medium risk).
3. Review free-text user inputs not yet covered: `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` fields passed to IMAP SEARCH — check whether imapflow sanitizes these or if there is an injection risk.
4. Review `get_email_by_id` / `download_attachment` — `emailId` and `attachmentIndex` args not validated for type/range at handler level before IMAP call.
5. `decodeCursor` — the `parsed.folder` field is accepted as-is without `validateTargetFolder()` check; a crafted cursor could inject a traversal path into the IMAP `getEmails()` call. LOW severity but worth closing.

---

## Cycle #5
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:30–00:45 Eastern
**Git commit:** `eb6d607`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–4 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `decodeCursor` — `parsed.folder` NOT validated before returning `EmailCursor`. A crafted base64url cursor with `../../etc` as the folder field would be accepted by the type check (`typeof parsed.folder === "string"`) and passed directly to `imapService.getEmails()`. (now fixed)
- `get_email_by_id` handler — `args.emailId` cast as `string` with no non-empty / numeric check. Service's `validateEmailId` throws with an opaque internal error message on bad input. (now fixed with handler-level guard)
- `download_attachment` handler — `args.email_id` has no non-empty check; `args.attachment_index` has no integer/range guard at handler level (service does `Math.trunc` + bounds check, returns null with generic "Attachment not found" for invalid index). (now fixed)

**Additional audit findings:**
- `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` fields — passed to imapflow `search()` criteria object. imapflow encodes IMAP SEARCH criteria via its own serialiser; no string interpolation into raw IMAP commands. Risk is LOW; callers see whatever imapflow produces for odd inputs. No handler-level guard added (imapflow handles this).
- All other handlers reviewed: no additional missing guards found. `cancel_scheduled_email` `args.id` — scheduler returns false for unknown IDs without a guard, but this is benign (no injection risk, friendly error already returned).

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`decodeCursor`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(parsed.folder) !== null` check inside `decodeCursor` before returning the cursor. Rejects cursors whose folder field contains `..`, control chars, or exceeds 1000 chars. Returns null (treated as "Invalid or expired cursor" by callers). (+2 lines)

2. **`get_email_by_id`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(rawEmailId)` guard at handler entry. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams, "emailId must be a non-empty numeric UID string.")` for empty, non-string, or non-numeric inputs. (+3 lines)

3. **`download_attachment`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(rawAttEmailId)` guard on `email_id` and `!Number.isInteger(rawAttIdx) || rawAttIdx < 0` guard on `attachment_index`. Both return `McpError(InvalidParams, ...)` with clear messages. (+6 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+16 lines, -5 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (258/258 tests, 14 test files)

### Git Status

- Commit: `eb6d607`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #6:**
1. Add unit tests for new `decodeCursor` folder-validation path and `get_email_by_id` / `download_attachment` handler-level guards (similar pattern to Cycle #4 test additions). (~20 tests, LOW risk)
2. `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` — consider adding max-length guards (e.g. 500 chars) to prevent excessively large IMAP SEARCH commands. LOW risk, LOW effort.
3. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, defer.
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, defer.

---

## Cycle #7
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 01:05–01:15 Eastern
**Git commit:** `714ec11`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–6 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `create_folder` handler — `args.folderName as string` passed directly to IMAP service with no handler-level `validateFolderName()` call. Service's private `validateFolderName()` does protect, but throws a raw `Error` (opaque internal message). (now fixed)
- `delete_folder` handler — same gap as `create_folder`. (now fixed)
- `rename_folder` handler — `args.oldName` and `args.newName` both unguarded at handler level. (now fixed)
- `mark_email_read` / `star_email` handlers — `args.emailId as string` had no numeric UID guard at handler level, unlike `get_email_by_id` (fixed in Cycle #5). Service's private `validateEmailId` throws raw `Error`. (now fixed)

**Additional audit findings (no new issues):**
- `reply_to_email` `inReplyTo` and `references` come from `original.inReplyTo` / `original.references` (fetched from IMAP trusted storage), not user args. SMTP service applies `stripHeaderInjection` on outbound — no additional guard needed.
- `sync_folders` takes no args — no validation needed.
- `save_draft` `inReplyTo`/`references` come from user args but are passed to SMTP service which sanitizes them via `stripHeaderInjection`. No injection risk identified.
- `mark_email_unread` does not exist as a separate case — handled by `mark_email_read` with `isRead: false`.
- `unstar_email` does not exist as a separate case — handled by `star_email` with `isStarred: false`.

**Systematic scan conclusion:** All string args in switch cases that reach IMAP path construction or SMTP now have either handler-level validation or are protected by hardcoded literals / service-layer sanitization. No new gaps found beyond the 5 handlers addressed this cycle.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`create_folder`** — Added `validateFolderName(args.folderName)` check at handler entry. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` for empty, slash-containing, traversal, control-char, or oversized names before IMAP call. (+4 lines)

2. **`delete_folder`** — Added identical `validateFolderName(args.folderName)` check. (+3 lines)

3. **`rename_folder`** — Added `validateFolderName(args.oldName)` and `validateFolderName(args.newName)` checks, each prefixing the field name in the error message for clarity. (+5 lines)

4. **`mark_email_read`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(merEmailId)` guard matching the existing `get_email_by_id` pattern. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams, "emailId must be a non-empty numeric UID string.")` (+4 lines)

5. **`star_email`** — Same numeric UID guard as `mark_email_read`. (+4 lines)

6. **Add 27 unit tests** — Three new `describe` blocks in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `create_folder / delete_folder handler validation (validateFolderName)` — 12 tests: valid names, empty, whitespace, null, undefined, slash, traversal, null byte, C0 control char, exact-255 boundary, 256 over-limit
   - `rename_folder handler validation (validateFolderName for oldName and newName)` — 5 tests: valid oldName/newName, traversal in oldName, empty newName, slash in newName
   - `mark_email_read / star_email handler validation (numeric emailId guard)` — 10 tests: valid "42", valid "1", empty, alphabetic, mixed, negative, float, null, undefined, null-byte injection
   (+125 lines in helpers.test.ts)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+20 lines, -2 lines), `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+125 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (314/314 tests, 14 test files, +27 new tests vs 287 in cycle 6)

### Git Status

- Commit: `714ec11`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #8:**
1. Remaining `args.X as Y` casts type-check audit — scan all remaining handlers for `as string` / `as number` / `as boolean` casts where the value reaches a service call without a runtime type-check at handler level. Focus on any cast where the JSON schema type is not strictly enforced by the MCP layer.
2. `save_draft` / `schedule_email` — audit `args.attachments as any` — check whether attachment objects (name, content, contentType) are validated or sanitized before IMAP `APPEND`.
3. Cursor token HMAC binding — still deferred (medium effort, low security payoff).
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).

---

## Cycle #8
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 01:20–01:35 Eastern
**Git commit:** `e0aa1dd`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–7 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `archive_email`, `move_to_trash`, `move_to_spam` — `args.emailId as string` with no handler-level numeric UID guard. IMAP service's private `validateEmailId` protected internally but produced raw `Error` (opaque message). (now fixed — consistent with `get_email_by_id`, `mark_email_read`, `star_email`)
- `move_email` — had targetFolder validation (Cycle #3) but no emailId guard at handler level. (now fixed)
- `delete_email` — same gap as move handlers. (now fixed)
- `bulk_delete_emails`, `bulk_move_emails`, `bulk_mark_read`, `bulk_star`, `bulk_move_to_label`, `bulk_remove_label` — all filtered `typeof id === "string" && id.length > 0` but did NOT validate items as numeric UIDs. Non-numeric strings silently passed to IMAP service, which threw a raw `Error`. (now fixed — filter updated to `/^\d+$/.test(id)`)
- `get_emails` folder — passed to `imapService.getEmails()` via `validateTargetFolder()`-free path. IMAP service's private `validateFolderName` guards empty/control-chars/length but NOT `..` traversal. (now fixed)

**Systematic scan conclusion:** All `args.emailId as string` casts in all handlers now have handler-level numeric UID guards. All bulk operations now filter to numeric UIDs. `get_emails` folder now validated. No remaining gaps found.

**Areas reviewed with no gaps:**
- `mark_email_unread` / `unstar_email`: Not separate cases — handled by `mark_email_read`/`star_email` with flag values (confirmed in Cycle #7, still intact).
- `get_folder_emails`: Does not exist as a case — no action needed.
- `request_permission_escalation` targetPreset: Uses `isValidEscalationTarget()` (imported from settings/security.ts) — already protected.
- `sync_emails` folder: Same `validateTargetFolder` gap as `get_emails` — also fixed this cycle.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`archive_email`, `move_to_trash`, `move_to_spam`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(emailId)` guard matching the existing pattern from `get_email_by_id`. Each handler now holds a named local variable (aeEmailId, mttEmailId, mtsEmailId) and throws `McpError(InvalidParams, "emailId must be a non-empty numeric UID string.")` for invalid inputs. (+9 lines each, 3 handlers)

2. **`move_email`** — Added numeric UID guard on `args.emailId` before the existing `validateTargetFolder` check. (+4 lines)

3. **`delete_email`** — Added numeric UID guard. (+4 lines)

4. **`get_emails`** — Added `validateTargetFolder(folder)` check immediately after resolving the folder default ("INBOX"). Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` for traversal/control-char/oversized folder names. (+3 lines)

5. **Bulk operations array-item filter** — Updated the `.filter()` predicate in `bulk_delete_emails`, `bulk_move_emails`, `bulk_mark_read`, `bulk_star`, `bulk_move_to_label`, and `bulk_remove_label` from `id.length > 0` to `/^\d+$/.test(id)`. Non-numeric IDs are now silently excluded before the IMAP call rather than producing opaque service errors. (6 handlers, 1 line each)

6. **Add 33 unit tests** — Three new `describe` blocks in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `archive_email / move_to_trash / move_to_spam / move_email / delete_email handler validation (numeric emailId guard)` — 11 tests: valid "42", valid "1", valid "999999", empty, "abc", "12x", "-5", "3.14", null, undefined, null-byte
   - `get_emails handler validation (validateTargetFolder for folder arg)` — 9 tests: INBOX, Folders/Work, empty, undefined, traversal, embedded-traversal, null-byte, over-limit, exact-limit
   - `bulk operation array-item numeric UID filter` — 13 tests: valid "42"/"1"/"100000", empty, "abc", "12x", "-3", "2.5", null, undefined, number 42 (not string), null-byte, array-of-mixed-inputs

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+40 lines, -12 lines), `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+151 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (347/347 tests, 14 test files, +33 new tests vs 314 in cycle 7)

### Git Status

- Commit: `e0aa1dd`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #9:**
1. `save_draft` / `schedule_email` attachment validation — `args.attachments as any` passes attachment objects directly to `imapService.saveDraft()`. Attachment `name`, `contentType`, `content` fields not validated at handler level. Risk is LOW (base64 content, MIME encoding by nodemailer/imapflow), but worth closing for completeness.
2. `move_to_label` / `remove_label` emailId — these two handlers still use `args.emailId as string` without a handler-level numeric UID guard (the IMAP service protects internally). Add guard for consistency.
3. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred.
4. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred.

---

## Cycle #9
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 01:40–01:55 Eastern
**Git commit:** `a30de17`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–8 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `move_to_label` handler — `args.emailId as string` passed to `imapService.moveEmail()` without handler-level numeric UID guard. Inconsistent with all other single-email action handlers. (now fixed)
- `remove_label` handler — same gap as `move_to_label`. (now fixed)
- `save_draft` / `schedule_email` attachment validation — `args.attachments as any` passed to services without handler-level field validation.

**New finding on attachment path:**
- `schedule_email` → `schedulerService.schedule()` → eventual `smtpService.sendEmail()`. The SMTP service already has full attachment validation (count cap, size cap, filename/contentType header-injection stripping, MIME type format check). No gap on this path.
- `save_draft` → `imapService.saveDraft()`. The `saveDraft` method in `simple-imap-service.ts` passed `att.filename` and `att.contentType` directly to nodemailer without ANY sanitization — unlike `smtp-service.ts` which strips CRLF/NUL from both fields and validates contentType format. A crafted attachment with `filename: "a.pdf\r\nContent-Type: text/html"` or `contentType: "text/html\r\nX-Injected: yes"` would break the MIME structure of the saved draft. This is a real (LOW severity) gap — now fixed at the service layer.

**Systematic scan conclusion:** ALL single-email action handlers now have handler-level numeric UID guards. The handler-level validation sweep that began in Cycle #5 is now complete for all handlers.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`move_to_label`** — Added `!/^\d+$/.test(mtlEmailId)` guard at handler entry before label validation. Local variable `mtlEmailId` used (consistent naming convention). `imapService.moveEmail()` now receives the validated variable, not the raw `args.emailId as string` cast. (+4 lines)

2. **`remove_label`** — Added identical `!/^\d+$/.test(rlEmailId)` guard before the existing `validateTargetFolder` check. (+4 lines)

3. **`saveDraft` attachment sanitization in `simple-imap-service.ts`** — Replaced the raw `att.filename` / `att.contentType` pass-through with inline sanitization mirroring `smtp-service.ts`:
   - `filename`: strip CRLF/NUL with `replace(/[\r\n\x00]/g, "")`, truncate to 255 chars, fall back to `"attachment"` if empty after strip.
   - `contentType`: strip CRLF/NUL, validate against `/^[\w!#$&\-^]+\/[\w!#$&\-^+.]+$/` (type/subtype format), fall back to `undefined` if invalid.
   (+17 lines, -5 lines)

4. **Add 27 unit tests** — Three new `describe` blocks in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`:
   - `move_to_label / remove_label handler validation (numeric emailId guard)` — 11 tests: valid "42"/"1"/"999999", empty, "abc", "12x", "-5", "3.14", null, undefined, null-byte
   - `saveDraft attachment filename sanitization` — 7 tests: plain filename, CRLF injection, LF injection, NUL byte, over-255-char, empty-after-strip fallback, undefined
   - `saveDraft attachment contentType sanitization` — 9 tests: valid "application/pdf"/"image/png"/"text/plain", CRLF injection rejected, NUL byte stripped then validated, no-slash rejected, empty undefined, undefined, spaces rejected
   (+128 lines in helpers.test.ts)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (+8 lines), `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` (+17 lines, -5 lines), `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+128 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (374/374 tests, 14 test files, +27 new tests vs 347 in cycle 8)

### Git Status

- Commit: `a30de17`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Handler-level validation sweep is now COMPLETE.** All single-email action handlers and folder-path handlers have been hardened over Cycles #1–#9. Shift focus to code quality, documentation, and test coverage gaps.

**Priority items for Cycle #10:**
1. Code quality — scan for unused imports in `src/index.ts` and service files (`import X from Y` that are never referenced). Remove dead code. (~LOW effort, improves maintainability)
2. Type safety — find remaining `as any` casts in production code (not test files). Assess whether they can be narrowed to proper types. Focus on `src/index.ts` and service files.
3. JSDoc coverage — add JSDoc comments to public methods in `src/services/` that are missing them (particularly `SimpleIMAPService` and `SmtpService` public methods). (~LOW effort, improves documentation)
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).
5. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred.

## Cycle #10
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 02:00–02:20 Eastern
**Git commit:** `d9242ee`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–9 fixes still intact.

**`as any` scan — `src/index.ts` (7 occurrences identified):**
- Line 1360: `(request.params as any)._meta?.progressToken` — AVOIDABLE. SDK's `CallToolRequestSchema` types `request.params._meta?.progressToken` directly (per `types.d.ts` line 29735). No cast needed.
- Lines 1516, 1755, 1784: `args.attachments as any[] | undefined` / `args.attachments as any | undefined` — AVOIDABLE. All three call sites pass to functions expecting `EmailAttachment[] | undefined`. Narrowed correctly; required adding `EmailAttachment` to the import.
- Lines 2723–2729: `(config.smtp as any).password = ""` etc. — AVOIDABLE. `SMTPConfig` and `IMAPConfig` interfaces use non-readonly fields. Direct assignment compiles cleanly.
- `progressToken` unused variable reference verified: `progressToken` IS referenced later in the file (progress notification path) — not dead code.

**`as any` scan — `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` (4 occurrences):**
- Line 774: `(result as any).uid` — REQUIRED. imapflow's `client.append()` return type does not include `uid` in its TypeScript declaration even though the runtime value includes it. Cannot remove without a custom type declaration file (deferred).
- Lines 1188–1196 (`wipeCache`): `(email as any).body = ""` etc. — AVOIDABLE. `EmailMessage.body`, `.subject`, `.from` are plain mutable `string` fields. Direct assignment works.
- Line 1196: `(att as any).content = undefined` — REQUIRED. `EmailAttachment.content` is typed `Buffer | string` (no `undefined`). Must preserve cast.

**`as any` scan — `src/services/analytics-service.ts` (6 occurrences in `wipeData`):**
- Lines 384–391: `(email as any).body/subject/from = ""` — AVOIDABLE. Same reason as `wipeCache`. Direct assignment compiles cleanly.

**`helpers.ts` review:**
- `validateFolderName`: contained a redundant `(folder as string).length` cast at the length check — TypeScript already narrows `folder` to `string` via the guard on line 201. Removed.
- `truncate()`: had only a one-line stub JSDoc. Expanded to full parameter-level docs.
- All other public functions: already have adequate JSDoc. No additional gaps found.

**`permissions/manager.ts` review:**
- All public methods (`check`, `rateLimitStatus`, `invalidate`) have JSDoc. Private helpers documented via inline comments. No type-safety gaps.

**`types/index.ts` review:**
- `LogEntry.data?: any` — appropriate use of `any` for unstructured log metadata. Leave as-is.
- `EmailAttachment.content?: Buffer | string` — `undefined` omitted deliberately (attached content must be present). Consistent with existing code.
- No required/optional field mismatches identified. All types complete.

**Unused imports scan — `src/index.ts`:**
- After adding `EmailAttachment` to line 24, all imports verified referenced. No unused imports found.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **`src/index.ts` line 1360** — Removed `as any` cast on `request.params._meta?.progressToken`. SDK type already covers this access. (−1 cast)

2. **`src/index.ts` lines 2723–2729** — Removed `as any` casts on credential scrubbing in shutdown handler. `config.smtp.password = ""` etc. compiles directly against `SMTPConfig`/`IMAPConfig` interfaces. (−5 casts)

3. **`src/index.ts` lines 1516, 1755, 1784** — Narrowed `args.attachments as any[] | undefined` / `as any | undefined` to `as EmailAttachment[] | undefined` in `send_email`, `save_draft`, and `schedule_email` handlers. Added `EmailAttachment` to line-24 import. (−3 casts, +1 import name)

4. **`src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` `wipeCache()`** — Replaced `(email as any).body/subject/from = ""` with direct property writes. (−3 casts)

5. **`src/services/analytics-service.ts` `wipeData()`** — Same fix for inbox and sent email loops. (−6 casts)

6. **`src/utils/helpers.ts` `validateFolderName()`** — Removed redundant `(folder as string).length` cast inside the post-guard length check. (−1 redundant cast)

7. **`src/utils/helpers.ts` `truncate()`** — Replaced one-line stub JSDoc with a full multi-line JSDoc including `@param` tags for `text` and `maxLength` with usage notes. (+5 lines)

**Total `as any` casts removed from production code this cycle: 9**
**Remaining unavoidable `as any` casts in production code: 2** (`(result as any).uid` in `client.append()` return; `(att as any).content = undefined` where type omits undefined)

**Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (import + 9 cast removals), `src/services/analytics-service.ts` (6 cast removals), `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` (3 cast removals), `src/utils/helpers.ts` (1 cast removal + JSDoc)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors, verified after each individual change)
- `npm test` — PASS (374/374 tests, 14 test files, no count change — no new tests this cycle)

### Git Status

- Commit: `d9242ee`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #11:**
1. JSDoc coverage — `SimpleIMAPService` and `SmtpService` public methods still largely undocumented. Adding JSDoc to the top-10 most-used public methods (e.g. `connect`, `disconnect`, `getEmails`, `getEmailById`, `saveDraft`, `sendEmail`, `markEmailRead`, `starEmail`, `moveEmail`, `searchEmails`). (~LOW effort, improves IDE support)
2. `(result as any).uid` in `simple-imap-service.ts` — Consider adding a small local interface `interface AppendResult { uid?: number }` to replace the `as any` cast cleanly. (~5 lines, zero risk)
3. `(att as any).content = undefined` in `wipeCache` — Consider making `EmailAttachment.content` optional (`content?: Buffer | string`) to allow direct null-out. Check whether any existing code assumes content is always defined. (~LOW effort, ~LOW risk)
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred.
5. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred.

## Cycle #11
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 02:25–02:40 Eastern
**Git commit:** `ec1aaf7`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–10 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `(result as any).uid` in `saveDraft` — imapflow `client.append()` return type omits `uid`. A local `interface AppendResult { uid?: number }` replaces the cast cleanly. (now fixed)
- `(att as any).content = undefined` in `wipeCache` — `EmailAttachment.content` was ALREADY typed as `content?: Buffer | string` (optional) in `types/index.ts`. The `as any` cast was entirely unnecessary. Direct `att.content = undefined` compiles cleanly. (now fixed)
- JSDoc coverage for public methods — `connect`, `disconnect`, `isActive`, `getFolders`, `getEmails`, `getEmailById`, `searchEmails`, `markEmailRead`, `starEmail`, `moveEmail` in `SimpleIMAPService`; `verifyConnection`, `sendEmail`, `sendTestEmail`, `close` in `SmtpService`. All 14 methods now documented. `saveDraft` already had JSDoc from a prior addition.

**Zero production `as any` casts remaining in production code** — all three cast sites in `simple-imap-service.ts` addressed over Cycles #10 and #11. `analytics-service.ts` and `index.ts` also clean. `smtp-service.ts` `wipeCredentials()` still has `(config.smtp as any).password` casts — noted for Cycle #12.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Add `interface AppendResult { uid?: number }` to `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts`** — One-line local interface added immediately after imports. Changed `(result as any).uid` to `(result as AppendResult).uid` in `saveDraft`. Removes the last `as any` cast from the IMAP service. (+2 lines, -0 lines net; 1 cast narrowed)

2. **Fix `(att as any).content = undefined` in `wipeCache()`** — `EmailAttachment.content` is already `content?: Buffer | string` (optional since type declaration). The cast was spurious. Changed to direct `att.content = undefined`. (0 lines, 1 cast removed)

3. **Add JSDoc to 14 public methods in `SimpleIMAPService` and `SmtpService`:**
   - `SimpleIMAPService`: `connect` (6-line JSDoc with 5 @param), `disconnect` (1-line), `isActive` (1-line), `getFolders` (1-line), `getEmails` (5-line with @param/@returns), `getEmailById` (3-line with @param/@returns), `searchEmails` (3-line with @param/@returns), `markEmailRead` (4-line with @param/@returns), `starEmail` (4-line with @param/@returns), `moveEmail` (4-line with @param/@returns) — 10 methods
   - `SmtpService`: `verifyConnection` (1-line), `sendEmail` (3-line with @param/@returns), `sendTestEmail` (4-line with @param/@returns), `close` (1-line) — 4 methods
   (+62 lines documentation)

**Total `as any` casts in production code: 0** (excluding `smtp-service.ts` `wipeCredentials` which uses casts on `SMTPConfig` fields — these are avoidable and deferred to Cycle #12)

**Files changed:** `src/services/simple-imap-service.ts` (+64 lines, -2 lines), `src/services/smtp-service.ts` (+12 lines, -0 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors, verified after each change)
- `npm test` — PASS (374/374 tests, 14 test files, count unchanged — no new tests this cycle)

### Git Status

- Commit: `ec1aaf7`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**All `as any` casts in primary service files now eliminated.** JSDoc coverage for core service public methods is complete.

**Priority items for Cycle #12:**
1. `smtp-service.ts` `wipeCredentials()` — still uses `(config.smtp as any).password = ""` etc. (3 casts). Avoidable: `SMTPConfig` fields are mutable strings, direct assignment compiles cleanly. (~LOW effort, 3 lines)
2. `clearCache()` in `simple-imap-service.ts` — no JSDoc comment. One-liner. (~trivial)
3. `wipeCache()` and `wipeCredentials()` in both services — both have brief JSDoc already. Review whether they need `@returns void` consistency.
4. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).
5. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred.

## Cycle #6
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-18 00:50–01:00 Eastern
**Git commit:** `403dcaa`
**Branch:** main
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-6

### Audit Highlights (new findings this cycle)

No new HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Confirmed all cycle 1–5 fixes still intact.

**Confirmed from Next Cycle Focus list:**
- `decodeCursor` — `validateTargetFolder` guard added in Cycle #5 had no unit tests covering its various rejection paths. (now tested)
- `get_email_by_id` — numeric UID guard from Cycle #5 had no unit tests. (now tested)
- `download_attachment` — `email_id` and `attachment_index` guards from Cycle #5 had no unit tests. (now tested)
- `search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` — no length cap at handler level. (now fixed)

**Additional audit items checked:**
- `search_emails` input schema reviewed: `from`, `to`, `subject` are unbound `string` fields with no `maxLength` in schema and no handler-level guard. Length checks added inline. imapflow encodes these safely; the new guard is defence-in-depth only.
- All other handlers reviewed — no additional gaps found.

### Work Completed This Cycle

1. **Add 29 unit tests in `src/utils/helpers.test.ts`** — Three new `describe` blocks:
   - `decodeCursor folder validation (validateTargetFolder)` — 8 tests: valid INBOX, valid path with slash, boundary (1000 chars), traversal `../../etc/passwd`, embedded `Labels/../INBOX`, null byte, C0 control char, over-limit (1001 chars)
   - `get_email_by_id handler validation (numeric UID guard)` — 10 tests: valid "12345", valid "1", empty string, "abc", "12a3", "-1", "1.5", null, undefined, null-byte injection
   - `download_attachment handler validation` — 11 tests: email_id valid/empty/non-numeric/null; attachment_index valid 0/valid 3/negative/-1/float 1.5/NaN/string "0"/undefined
   (+179 lines in helpers.test.ts)

2. **`search_emails` max-length guards** — Added `MAX_SEARCH_TEXT = 500` constant and three length checks (for `from`, `to`, `subject`) at handler entry in `src/index.ts`. Returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` with a clear message for each. (+12 lines)

**Files changed:** `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` (+179 lines), `src/index.ts` (+12 lines)

### Validation Results

- `npm run build` — PASS (0 TypeScript errors)
- `npm test` — PASS (287/287 tests, 14 test files, +29 new tests vs 258 in cycle 5)

### Git Status

- Commit: `403dcaa`
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

### Next Cycle Focus

**Priority items for Cycle #7:**
1. Cursor token HMAC binding — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, low security payoff since cursors are ephemeral paginated tokens).
2. IMAP reconnect / NOOP health check — architectural backlog, still deferred (medium effort, moderate risk).
3. Review remaining any-typed `args` casts in handlers — identify whether any args are passed to services without a runtime type-check (find patterns like `args.X as Y` where Y is a complex type or object).
4. `create_folder` / `rename_folder` — `folderName` / `newName` args: check whether `validateFolderName()` (or equivalent) is called before passing to IMAP service.
