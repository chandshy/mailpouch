# Final Security & Quality Audit Report
## Codebase: protonmail-mcp-server
## Date: 2026-03-18
## Cycles completed: 36

### Cycle #36 Addendum

Cycle #36 identified and resolved three quality gaps:

1. **`reply_to_email` `replyAll` boolean type guard** — `if (args.replyAll)` evaluated truthiness with no `typeof` check. A non-boolean truthy value (e.g. `"true"`, `1`) would silently trigger reply-all mode and include all original CC recipients without any error. Added `if (args.replyAll !== undefined && typeof args.replyAll !== "boolean") throw McpError(InvalidParams)`, consistent with all other boolean field guards in the codebase.
2. **`search_emails` `dateFrom`/`dateTo` string type guards** — Both date filter fields used `args.dateFrom as string` with no `typeof` check. A Date object, number, or other non-string truthy value would be silently cast and forwarded to imapflow as an unparseable string (e.g. `"[object Date]"`), returning zero results with no error. Added `typeof !== "string"` guards for both, consistent with the `from`/`to`/`subject` string guards in the same handler (Cycle #35).
3. **`get_emails_by_label` / `move_to_label` / `bulk_move_to_label` `label` string type guard** — All three handlers cast `args.label as string` with no `typeof` check before calling `validateLabelName()`. A number or object value produces an opaque validation message rather than a clear `McpError(InvalidParams)`. Added `!args.label || typeof args.label !== "string"` guard in all three handlers, consistent with the existing required-string guard pattern throughout the codebase.

No security findings beyond the above. Build clean. 844/844 tests pass (+27 over Cycle #35 baseline of 817).

---

### Cycle #35 Addendum

Cycle #35 identified and resolved five quality gaps:

1. **`search_emails` `from`/`to`/`subject` string type guards** — The Cycle #6 length caps used `args.X && (args.X as string).length > 500` without a `typeof` check. A non-string truthy value (e.g. `42`) has `undefined` as `.length` at runtime, so `undefined > 500` is `false` and the value passes silently to imapflow. Added `typeof !== "string"` guard before each length check.
2. **`search_emails` `hasAttachment` boolean type guard** — `as boolean | undefined` cast with no runtime check. A non-boolean truthy value passes to imapflow and triggers the attachment filter via JS truthiness. Added `typeof !== "boolean"` guard consistent with mark/star handler guards (Cycle #34).
3. **`search_emails` `isRead` and `isStarred` boolean type guards** — Same `as boolean | undefined` cast issue. Added equivalent guards for both filter fields.
4. **`save_draft` `inReplyTo` string type guard** — `as string | undefined` cast with no runtime check. A non-string value would produce a malformed Message-ID in the MIME draft. Added `typeof !== "string"` guard.
5. **`save_draft` `references` array and per-item type guards** — `as string[] | undefined` cast with no shape check. A non-array or an array with non-string items would produce malformed `References` headers. Added `Array.isArray()` check and per-item `typeof !== "string"` check.

No security findings beyond the above. Build clean. 817/817 tests pass (+54 over Cycle #34 baseline of 763).

---

### Cycle #34 Addendum

Cycle #34 identified and resolved six quality gaps:

1. **`reply_to_email` `body` max-length cap** — Cycle #33 added the `MAX_BODY_LENGTH = 10 MB` cap to `send_email`, `save_draft`, and `schedule_email` but missed `reply_to_email`. A multi-megabyte reply body would exhaust Node.js heap or cause an opaque SMTP timeout. Added the same guard.
2. **`forward_email` `fwdBody` max-length cap** — The forwarded body is assembled from the user's optional message plus the original email's body (not controlled by the caller). A very large original email body passes unchecked. Added cap after assembly using the same `MAX_BODY_LENGTH`.
3. **`mark_email_read` `isRead` boolean type guard** — `args.isRead as boolean` with no runtime check. A non-boolean truthy value (e.g. `"yes"`, `1`) silently marked emails read based on JS truthiness. Added `typeof isRead !== "boolean"` guard.
4. **`star_email` `isStarred` boolean type guard** — Same issue. Added equivalent guard.
5. **`bulk_mark_read` `isRead` boolean type guard** — Same cast issue in the bulk handler. Added the same guard for consistency.
6. **`bulk_star` `isStarred` boolean type guard** — Same cast issue in the bulk handler. Added the same guard.

No security findings beyond the above. Build clean. 763/763 tests pass (+26 over Cycle #33 baseline of 737).

---

### Cycle #33 Addendum

Cycle #33 identified and resolved two quality gaps:

1. **`isHtml` boolean type guard in 4 handlers** — `send_email`, `reply_to_email`, `save_draft`, and `schedule_email` all used `args.isHtml as boolean | undefined` with no runtime type check. A non-boolean truthy value (e.g. `"yes"`, `1`, `[true]`) passed silently to nodemailer which evaluates it as truthy and enables HTML rendering mode without any error to the caller. Added `if (args.isHtml !== undefined && typeof args.isHtml !== "boolean") throw new McpError(InvalidParams)` in all four handlers, consistent with the type guards for all other optional fields.
2. **`body` max-length cap in 3 send handlers** — No upper bound existed on outbound email body length. A 100 MB body would exhaust Node.js heap or cause an SMTP timeout with an opaque delivery failure. For `schedule_email` the body is serialized to disk, making an oversized body a persistent resource drain. Added `MAX_BODY_LENGTH = 10 MB` constant and guard in `send_email`, `save_draft`, and `schedule_email`.

No security findings beyond the above. Build clean. 737/737 tests pass (+17 over Cycle #32 baseline of 720).

---

### Cycle #32 Addendum

Cycle #32 identified and resolved three quality gaps:

1. **`send_test_email` `customMessage` missing type guard** — A non-string `customMessage` (number, array, object) is truthy, satisfies the SMTP service's `customMessage || <default>` fallback, and is silently coerced to a string producing garbled HTML in the test email body. Added `if (args.customMessage !== undefined && typeof args.customMessage !== "string") throw new McpError(InvalidParams)` consistent with the `message` guard in `forward_email` (Cycle #31).
2. **`get_logs` outputSchema missing `data` field** — `LogEntry.data?: any` is included in log entries returned by `getLogs()` but was not documented in the outputSchema items. Added `data` property with a descriptive entry.
3. **`list_labels` `(f: any)` cast** — Filter parameter typed as `any` despite `getFolders()` returning `EmailFolder[]`. Replaced with `(f: EmailFolder)` and removed spurious optional chaining. `EmailFolder` added to imports.

No security findings. Build clean. 720/720 tests pass (+10 over Cycle #31 baseline of 710).

---

### Cycle #21 Addendum

Cycle #21 identified and fixed four documentation accuracy issues that survived the 20-cycle series:

1. **`package.json` description** — "45 tools" corrected to "47 tools". This field is displayed on the npm registry and in `npm search` results.
2. **`CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` heading** — "Cycles #1–#15" corrected to "Cycles #1–#19".
3. **`CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` test count** — Baseline corrected from 281 to 212; net-new delta corrected from +135 to +204.
4. **`CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` missing Documentation section** — Added 7-item section documenting Cycles 16–19 improvements (README, MCP Prompts table, settings UI, outputSchema completeness).

No code changes. Build clean. 416/416 tests pass. Commit `101c528`.

### Executive Summary

After 20 autonomous improvement cycles (Cycles 1–19 code changes, Cycle 20 final audit), the `protonmail-mcp-server` codebase is in excellent condition. All originally identified security vulnerabilities have been resolved. The codebase has zero path traversal vulnerabilities, zero unguarded numeric ID fields, zero avoidable `as any` casts in production code, zero unbounded memory-growth paths, and fully validated inputs across all 30 MCP tool handlers. The test suite grew from approximately 27 tests to 416 tests. The build is clean. No HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW severity issues remain open.

---

### Security Posture

All security issues found during the 19 code cycles have been resolved:

**Path Traversal / IMAP Injection**
- RESOLVED (Cycle 1) — `get_emails_by_label`, `move_to_folder`, `remove_label`, `bulk_remove_label`: path traversal via label/folder args.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 3) — `move_email`, `bulk_move_emails`: missing `validateTargetFolder()` call before IMAP path construction.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 5) — `decodeCursor()`: crafted base64 cursors could inject traversal paths via the `folder` field.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 7) — `create_folder`, `rename_folder`, `delete_folder`: folder name args not validated before IMAP call.

**Numeric UID Injection**
- RESOLVED (Cycle 5) — `get_email_by_id`, `download_attachment`: no handler-level type/numeric check on `emailId` / `attachmentIndex`.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 7) — `mark_email_read`, `star_email`: missing numeric UID guard.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 8) — `archive_email`, `trash_email`, `spam_email`, `move_email`, `delete_email`: missing UID guards; bulk ops now filter to digit-only IDs.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 9) — `move_to_label`, `remove_label`: missing numeric emailId guard.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 13) — Extracted `requireNumericEmailId()` helper; all ~12 guard sites in `src/index.ts` unified and DRY.

**Input Validation — Free-text Fields**
- RESOLVED (Cycle 3) — `send_test_email`: invalid `to` address not rejected at handler entry.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 6) — `search_emails`: no max-length guard on `from`/`to`/`subject` (capped at 500 chars each).
- RESOLVED (Cycle 15) — `send_email`, `save_draft`, `schedule_email`: attachment objects not shape-validated; `validateAttachments()` helper added.

**Memory / Unbounded Growth**
- RESOLVED (Cycle 2) — `SchedulerService.load()`: `pruneHistory()` added; non-pending records >30 days old dropped, cap at 1000 records.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 2) — `Analytics.getEmailStats()`: `Math.min/max(...dates)` on unbounded array replaced with `reduce`.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 8+) — `getEmails()`: hard cap of 200 emails enforced at service layer; all handler-level `limit` args clamped 1–500 before service calls.

**Attachment / MIME Sanitization**
- RESOLVED (Cycle 4) — `send_test_email` body/subject: emoji in HTML replaced with plain ASCII.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 9) — `saveDraft`: attachment filename/contentType CRLF/NUL stripping and MIME type validation added, mirroring `sendEmail()`.

**Type Safety / `as any` Casts**
- RESOLVED (Cycles 10–12) — 17 avoidable `as any` casts removed across `src/index.ts`, `analytics-service.ts`, `simple-imap-service.ts`, `smtp-service.ts`, `security/memory.ts`. Two genuinely unavoidable casts (imapflow type gap, optional field omission) were documented and then also resolved: `AppendResult` interface added (Cycle 11), `att.content = undefined` made direct (Cycle 11), `wipeCredentials()` casts removed (Cycle 12), `scrubEmail()` casts removed (Cycle 12). Zero avoidable `as any` casts remain.

**Output Schema Accuracy**
- RESOLVED (Cycles 18–19) — `get_connection_status`: 6 missing fields added (`smtp.lastCheck`, `smtp.insecureTls`, `smtp.error`, `imap.insecureTls`, `settingsConfigured`, `settingsConfigPath`).
- RESOLVED (Cycle 19) — `list_scheduled_emails`: `retryCount` field added.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 19) — `get_email_analytics`: 4 bare `{type:"object"}` entries expanded to full typed schemas matching `EmailAnalytics` interface.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 19) — `get_contacts`: 4 missing `Contact` fields added (`name`, `firstInteraction`, `averageResponseTime`, `isFavorite`).

**Open Security Items:** None. Risk level: LOW overall.

### Code Quality

**Type Safety**
- Zero avoidable `as any` casts in any production source file.
- All handler args typed with explicit guards before use.
- Two structural interfaces added (`AppendResult`, narrowed casts) to bridge imapflow type gaps.

**DRY / Abstraction**
- `validateLabelName()`, `validateFolderName()`, `validateTargetFolder()` extracted to `src/utils/helpers.ts` (Cycle 2).
- `requireNumericEmailId()` extracted; eliminated ~12 duplicated guard blocks across `src/index.ts` (Cycle 13).
- `validateAttachments()` extracted for all three attachment-bearing handlers (Cycle 15).
- Label validation in `move_to_label` / `bulk_move_to_label` refactored from inline 3-block if-chains to `validateLabelName()` calls, net -14 lines (Cycle 14).

**JSDoc Coverage**
- All public methods on `SimpleIMAPService` (10 methods) and `SmtpService` (4 methods + `saveDraft`) documented (Cycle 11).
- `clearCache()` documented (Cycle 12).
- `truncate()` expanded with parameter-level JSDoc (Cycle 10).
- All validation helpers in `helpers.ts` carry full JSDoc with `@param`, `@returns`, `@throws` annotations.

**Logging Safety**
- `parseEmails()` now calls `logger.warn()` for each dropped invalid address (Cycle 3).
- `sanitizeForLog()` strips full C0/C1 control-character set before truncating (prevents log injection).

**Documentation Accuracy**
- README tool count corrected from 45 to 47 (Cycle 16).
- Settings UI embedded HTML corrected from "40 tools" to "47 tools" in two places (Cycle 17).
- MCP Prompts section expanded from 3 entries to full 5-row table matching registered prompts (Cycle 17).
- CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section added documenting all Cycle 1–15 improvements (Cycle 16).

**Key areas added across cycles:**
- All path-traversal guard branches (positive and negative) — Cycles 1–7
- Cursor folder-validation guard — Cycle 5
- Numeric UID guard for 12 handlers — Cycles 5, 7, 8, 9
- `requireNumericEmailId` centralized guard — Cycle 13
- `healthCheck()` NOOP probe — Cycle 13
- `validateAttachments()` — Cycle 15
- `pruneHistory()` — Cycle 2

---

### Architecture

**Connection Health Probe**
`SimpleIMAPService.healthCheck()` added (Cycle 13), wired into `get_connection_status` response as `imap.healthy` (Cycle 14). Agents can now detect silent IMAP disconnects without attempting a full operation.

**Scheduler Persistence**
`SchedulerService.pruneHistory()` ensures the persisted JSON does not grow unboundedly. Non-pending records older than 30 days are evicted on every `load()` call; total records capped at 1000.

**Permission / Rate-Limit System**
`PermissionManager` rolling-window rate limiter with `rateLimitStatus()` and escalation system in place. Rate-limit timestamps are evicted on every `consumeRateSlot()` call — no unbounded array growth.

**MCP Output Schemas**
All 30 registered tools now have accurate, fully-typed `outputSchema` declarations. This enables downstream MCP clients and agents to validate and introspect tool responses without runtime surprises.

**Security Hardening Layer**
`src/security/memory.ts` (credential wiping), `src/permissions/manager.ts` (rate limiting + escalation), `src/config/schema.ts` (config validation), and `src/settings/server.ts` (settings UI with CSP headers) form a layered defense.

---

### Open / Deferred Items

The following items were assessed and intentionally deferred. None are blocking.

**Cursor HMAC binding** (`TODO_IMPROVEMENTS.md` item 5)
Adding HMAC to the base64url cursor would bind it to a server instance and prevent cursor reuse across restarts. Risk is LOW: the cursor only encodes `{folder, offset, limit}` — no sensitive data. The folder field is already validated against traversal on decode (Cycle 5). Deferred: low security impact relative to complexity of adding a stable secret.

**IMAP silent-disconnect detection** (`TODO_IMPROVEMENTS.md` item 6 / item 27)
If the IMAP server drops the TCP connection without sending a `close` event, `isConnected` stays true until the next operation throws. `healthCheck()` (Cycle 13) partially addresses this by surfacing liveness to agents. Full proactive reconnect logic (polling NOOP in background) was assessed in Cycle 18 and found unnecessary: read-path methods catch and return empty arrays; write-path errors propagate to `safeErrorMessage()`. Deferred as low-value given existing resilience.

**`save_draft` / `schedule_email` attachment size limit**
The service layer sanitizes filename and content-type (Cycle 9) and the handler validates attachment shape (Cycle 15). A per-attachment size cap (e.g. 25 MB) is not enforced. Node.js / nodemailer will reject oversized payloads at the SMTP level. Deferred: low risk.

---

### Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Keep test count above 416.** Any new tool handler added must include handler-level input validation tests covering at least: empty input, type mismatch, traversal/control-char attempt, and a valid-input success case.

2. **Use `requireNumericEmailId()` for all new emailId handlers.** The helper in `src/utils/helpers.ts` is the canonical guard for IMAP UID strings. Do not reintroduce inline `!/^\d+$/.test(...)` blocks.

3. **Extend `validateAttachments()` if attachment fields expand.** If the attachment schema gains new required fields (e.g. `encoding`, `cid`), add them to the validator and add corresponding tests.

4. **Review `outputSchema` when return shapes change.** The 19-cycle effort to keep schemas accurate is valuable for agent introspection. Any change to a tool's returned object must be reflected in its `outputSchema` in `src/index.ts`.

5. **Consider HMAC cursor binding if multi-user or multi-instance deployment is planned.** Currently the server is a single-user local bridge. If the deployment model changes, add a stable per-instance secret and HMAC-sign the cursor payload.

6. **Monitor imapflow type definitions.** The `AppendResult` local interface (Cycle 11) bridges a gap in imapflow's type exports. If a future imapflow version exports this type natively, remove the local declaration.

7. **Run `npm test` and `npm run build` before any release.** Both are clean at this writing (416 tests pass, tsc exits 0, no warnings).
